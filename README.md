This is my undergraduate dissertation. It is a binay clasifier of MRI brain tumour images using the pytorch framework. The brain tumour dataset retrieved from Kaggle (user who uploaded dataset: Praneet0327, Kaggle) contains 2000 negative instances or non-tumorous images, this class includes MRI images of people who don't appear to have any brain tumours. 
This is the reference data for healthy brain states and architecture. The dataset also includes 3266 images with tumours this includes patients with gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas, 
among other forms of brain tumours. These images demonstrate the existence of tumours in the brain at various stages and locations.
